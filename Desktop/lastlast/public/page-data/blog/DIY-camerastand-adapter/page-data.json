So simple, yet so useful. Since my sister got her camera back in December of 2014, our Manfrotto camera stand has been so very useful. From school theatre class projects, to food photography to family photos (minus having to balance one's device precariously on a ledge that would lead to the device's destruction if even a slight breeze were to tip it over), the camera stand has become an indispensable asset when it comes to photography.</p>\n<h1>New Camera</h1>\n<p>I'm seventeen and I've only had three different phones my whole life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple iPhone 4 (2014-2016)</li>\n<li>Xiaomi Redmi 4X (2016-2020)</li>\n<li>Apple iPhone 11 (2020-Present)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll tell you what.

I was going to take so many amazing photos and videos of my July trip to Colombia, but, of course, <strong>CORONAVIRUS</strong>.</p>\n<h1>How Coronavirus Changed my Summer Plans</h1>\n<p>Instead of heading over to South America for a few weeks, my dad took me to Murtle Lake in Wells Gray Provincial Park, British Columbia.</p>\n<p>Of course, I wanted to document every part of this trip because, from what I heard, the views were amazing.</p>\n<h1>DIY Camera Stand Phone Adapter</h1>\n<p><strong>Now comes the fun part!</strong> </p>\n<p>Instead of bringing my sister's heavy camera, I wanted to bring my iPhone to take photos that could compete with her camera. I also wanted to take timelapse videos, thus a camera stand was a necessity.</p>\n<h2>Step 1</h2>\n<p>Remove camera stand camera adapter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"tl_murtle.MOV\" alt=\"taken on camera stand\"></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"DIY-camerastand-adapter"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721","3000541721","440568431"]}
